# Smart_water_bar
Design and implementation of a control system for a water bar in stages: requirements analysis, block diagram construction, hardware design using simulation tools and laboratory devices, hardware implementation on a connection matrix and PCB board design. In addition, the entire system is implemented separately using a microcontroller (Arduino).
